## **Introduction**
Gradual typing is to mix static and dynamic data typing in the same codebase. Doing this ensures data type safety and flexibility. This literature review investigates the performance and reliability of gradual typing in modern programming languages like TypeScript and Python.

## **Exploration Using GPT-4o**

1. **Historical Background**

Before gradual typing, the field was divided into two camps: statically typed languages, which prioritized early error detection, and dynamically typed languages, which emphasized flexibility.

The concept of gradual typing was first formalized in 2006 by Jeremy Siek and Walid Taha in their seminal paper *Gradual Typing for Functional Languages*. This hybrid typing system gained popularity as dynamically typed languages like JavaScript and Python grew, providing a way to introduce static types for added reliability without losing flexibility. The motivation was to offer flexibility, allowing developers to start with dynamic typing and introduce static types incrementally. Historically, languages like JavaScript, Ruby, and Python began as dynamically typed, prioritizing rapid development cycles over static type safety. Gradual typing allowed these languages to evolve while maintaining backward compatibility with their dynamic nature.

2. **Key Languages Adopting Gradual Typing**

Languages like TypeScript and Python have implemented gradual typing to bridge static and dynamic paradigms. TypeScript enforces type safety while maintaining compatibility with JavaScript, and Python's optional type hints (introduced in PEP 484) give developers the freedom to gradually introduce static types.

3. **Subfields of PL**

Gradual typing primarily draws from type theory, specifically from subfields related to type inference and type soundness. Researchers have explored how to build type systems that can accommodate both static and dynamic checks without sacrificing efficiency. Advances in compiler design have also been critical, particularly in optimizing the runtime performance of gradually typed languages. Additionally, gradual typing interacts with subfields like runtime verification and program analysis, where dynamic type checks need to be efficient.

The development of gradual typing required collaboration between type theory and compiler optimization techniques. Type theory provided the conceptual framework for how types could be gradually introduced and inferred, while compiler technology provided practical solutions for minimizing runtime performance penalties. As gradual typing became more widely adopted, its presence in modern programming languages influenced other subfields like program verification, where type soundness plays a crucial role in ensuring software correctness.

4. **Performance Challenges**
   
Gradual typing introduces runtime overhead due to type checks between static and dynamic sections. Recent research focuses on optimizing these checks and enhancing type inference algorithms to mitigate performance issues.

5. **Developer Experience and Code Maintainability**
   
Gradual typing enhances code maintainability, allowing developers to introduce types progressively as projects grow. However, managing the interaction between dynamic and static types can add complexity.

6. **Recent Research Trends**
   
Recent trends in gradual typing include improvements in type inference algorithms, reducing the cognitive load for developers when transitioning from dynamic to static typing. Researchers are also investigating ways to optimize runtime type checks through static analysis techniques. For example, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers are being designed to perform type checks more efficiently, reducing the runtime performance overhead often associated with gradual typing systems.

Advances in type inference and compiler optimizations are making gradual typing more efficient. Researchers are exploring ways to reduce runtime costs and improve the integration between static and dynamic types.

The most influential researchers in gradual typing are Jeremy Siek and Walid Taha, whose 2006 paper laid the theoretical foundation for gradual typing systems. Their research showed that gradual typing could be integrated into functional languages, but its principles have since been adopted by object-oriented and scripting languages as well.

Other notable contributors include Sam Tobin-Hochstadt and Matthias Felleisen, who extended the theory of gradual typing to object-oriented programming languages through their work on Typed Racket. In the realm of Python, the introduction of PEP 484 by Guido van Rossum and the ongoing development of the mypy type checker have popularized the use of type hints, making Python a key player in the gradual typing movement.

4. Trade-offs between static, dynamic, and gradual typing:

Let's examine some specific scenarios and benchmarks:

a) Space/Time Complexity:
- Static Typing: C++ programs typically have the lowest memory footprint and fastest execution.
- Dynamic Typing: Python programs often use more memory due to dynamic dispatch and boxing of primitive types.
- Gradual Typing: TypeScript compiled to JavaScript performs similarly to plain JavaScript, while gradually typed Python with runtime checks can be slower.

- Gradual Typing: TypeScript allows developers to incrementally add types, balancing flexibility and safety.

5. Recent advancements in type inference for gradual typing:

Let's explore these advancements with more technical detail:

a) Flow-sensitive type inference:
- Technique: Analyzes control flow to refine types within different branches.
- Example in TypeScript:
  ```typescript
  function example(x: string | number) {
    if (typeof x === "string") {
      console.log(x.toUpperCase());  // x is inferred as string here
    } else {
      console.log(x.toFixed(2));     // x is inferred as number here
    }
  }
  ```

b) Shape analysis:
- Technique: Infers structural types based on object usage.
- Example in Python with mypy:
  ```python
  from typing import TypedDict

  class Point(TypedDict):
      x: float
      y: float

  def distance(p: Point) -> float:
      return (p['x']**2 + p['y']**2)**0.5
  ```

c) Machine learning-based type inference:
- Technique: Uses ML models trained on large codebases to predict types.
- Example: Microsoft's TypeScript team is experimenting with ML models to suggest more accurate types in complex scenarios.

d) Incremental type checking:
- Technique: Only rechecks changed portions of code and their dependencies.
- Example: Flow's incremental mode, which significantly speeds up type checking in large projects.

e) Intersection and union types:
- Technique: Allows more expressive type combinations.
- Example in TypeScript:
  ```typescript
  type Serializable = string | number | boolean | null | undefined;
  type SerializableArray = Serializable[];

  function process(input: SerializableArray & { length: 5 }) {
    // input is an array of serializable values with exactly 5 elements
  }
  ```

f) Gradual typing with blame:
- Technique: Tracks the origin of type errors in mixed typed/untyped code.
- Example: Reticulated Python's implementation assigns blame to either typed or untyped code regions when runtime type errors occur.

g) Optional and nullable types:
- Technique: Explicitly represents the presence or absence of a value.
- Example in Kotlin:
  ```kotlin
  fun strlen(s: String?): Int = s?.length ?: 0
  ```

These advancements continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with gradual typing, making it an increasingly attractive option for large-scale software development.
